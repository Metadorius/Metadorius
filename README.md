### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an inspired software engineer both at heart and in life (well, actually, in process of getting a software engineering degree at the moment). Currently I am a developer in [Phobos](https://github.com/Phobos-developers) and [CnCNet](https://cncnet.org) teams and run a few **Command & Conquer**-related communities. What I'm mainly occupied with now is public **Command & Conquer**-related projects, such as:
 - [XNA CnCNet Client](https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client) [and my own fork of it](https://github.com/Metadorius/xna-cncnet-client) - both of them provide a way to play legacy C&C titles online and on modern system;
 - [CnCNet Discord bot](https://github.com/Metadorius/cncnet-discord-bot) which provides connection of aforementioned CnCNet client-based mod or game lobbies and lists game rooms in a Discord server channel;
 - [Phobos](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/Phobos) - an [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares)-compatible Yuri's Revenge engine extension project which provides mod makers with additional possibilites for their mods;
 - ...and also other numerous projects within the community where I didn't contribute as much.

My main sphere of knowledge and my skills lie in backend web development and desktop development. I am also interested in game development, reverse engineering, low-level stuff, DevOps etc. I try to always learn something new that interests me, not only programming-related, but sadly it's not possible to learn everything :)

You can support me on [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kerbiter) (which is the only possible way to do so at the moment).
