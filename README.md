### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

[![Support me on Patreon](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshieldsio-patreon.vercel.app%2Fapi%3Fusername%3Dkerbiter%26type%3Dpledges&style=flat)](https://patreon.com/kerbiter)

I'm an inspired software engineer both at heart and in life. I am one of the founders of [Phobos](https://github.com/Phobos-developers) and one of the admins of [CnCNet](https://cncnet.org) and run a few **Command & Conquer**-related communities.

My most important projects which I either created or help manage/maintain are mostly **Command & Conquer**-related projects, such as:
 - [Phobos](https://github.com/Phobos-developers/Phobos) - an [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares)-compatible Yuri's Revenge engine extension project which provides mod makers with additional possibilites for their mods;
 - [XNA CnCNet Client](https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client) - a front-end application using C# and a custom for legacy C&C games to be played on modern systems;
 - ...and also other numerous projects within the community where I didn't contribute as much.

Recently I've been advancing in general software architecturing, problem solving and management. Tech-wise my main skills are desktop development (C#), reverse-engineering/patching (C++, ASM), backend development (Python). I am also interested in game development, low-level stuff, embedded development, DevOps etc.
